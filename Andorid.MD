## Android

Prerecrisets
-You will need a armv6 or armv7 device. Don't know what you have https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-know-if-an-Android-device-is-running-on-ARMv7-or-ARMv6. 
-Internet access to the device and access to the google play store. It is possible to perform installation off-line but I wonâ€™t go into that here.
-Root (optional) for optimizing your device. Not necessary
-You will need background data turned on and battery saver turn off

1) Start by installing Termux from the play store, and start it up. On first startup it will download and install a base gnu OS and chroot into it. On some systems Termux will start with limited permissions, in that case enter su 

2) Install arch linux inside termux 

pkg install wget

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdrausty/TermuxArch/master/setupTermuxArch.sh

bash setupTermuxArch.sh

3) Enter archlinux chroot

startarch

4) Install dependices
 
 pacman -Sy nodejs-lts-carbon python2 base-devel npm
 
 ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python

5) Download zenbot and configure

git clone https://github.com/deviavir/zenbot.git

cd zenbot

cp conf-sample.js conf.js

nano conf.js

npm install

6) install mongodb
you have 2 options 
 Option 1) archlinux mongodb. In a new termux session(scroll from left side of screen)
 
 pacman -S mongodb 
 
 lunch with the command
 
 mongod 
 
 Option 2) native android mongodb with "dory mongodb" in play store

7) After you have mongodb running start zenbot with

 bash zenbot.sh (standard options)


8) restarting
close all termux sessions
from a fresh termux session

 startarch
 
 cd zenbot
 
 bash zenbot.sh


9) Optimizing (Optional) Only if your know what your doing
you will need root on the device
you will need to know a bit about linux to continue namely how to find the pid of your termux process
you will need a native terminal(not termux) and enable shell access in development options
being your no file SOFT and HARD no file limits 10000 works nicely on a pixel2 you will need to experiment with your device
enter this as root, a warning asking for root permissions may appear, grant them.

su

pr limit ${PID} 7 SOFT HARD 

 Inside your termux arch chroot you will need to edit the file /etc/security/limits.conf and adjust your no file to match.
